The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class {
  color: red; /* This rule will not override the div rule */
}

#my-id.my-class {  /* This rule will override both div and .my-class due to higher specificity */
  color: green;
}

<div id="my-id" class="my-class"></div>
```

In this example, a `div` element with the id `my-id` and class `my-class` has three potential CSS rules that could affect its color.  The rule with `#my-id.my-class` has the highest specificity and wins, resulting in green text. The `.my-class` selector, while more specific than the `div` selector, does not override the rule with `#my-id.my-class` because the ID selector has the greatest weight in specificity calculations. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not aware of how specificity works.
