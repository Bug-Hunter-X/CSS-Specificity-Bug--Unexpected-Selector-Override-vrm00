To fix this bug, you can adjust the CSS rules to ensure the desired style is applied.  One approach might be to increase the specificity of the intended rule or to refactor your CSS to be more explicit and avoid conflicts.

Here's a possible solution:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class {
  color: red;
}

#my-id {
  color: green;
}

/* Using !important is generally discouraged, but shown here as an option */
.my-class {
  color: red !important; /*this overrides all rules */
}
```

In this solution, we've separated the selectors to avoid specificity conflicts. Another approach would be to change the selectors to be more specific if possible. Using `!important` is generally not recommended for maintaining clean and easily manageable CSS, unless absolutely necessary as it reduces readability and maintainability of code.
